\label{Summary}

\quad Recently, many applications have begun to use a branch of Machine Learning called TinyML. This paper exploits a new system based on this technology. Specifically, the application implements a Continual Learning (CL) system on the Max78000 board, a new breed of AI microcontroller built to enable neural networks to execute at ultra-low power and live at the edge of IoT. Via a CL system, the application learns a new class with small and efficient training. The entire network model is a CNN system that runs on a hardware-based accelerator.
